CREATE MODE (OSU mode):
    Before opening: To make a beatmap, follow this guide (with a link)

ASSIST AREA
    Present below the beatmap view for local/online

HIGH SCORES:
    Have a brief warning next to the "play" button for online mode if we aren't logged in (Not logged in! Can't post highscore.)
    On entering the "high score" section and if we aren't using any assists, send user ID and score data to the server
    Read high scores from the server (another manager lol) and refresh every time the CustomBeatmapsUI is opened.

MIS-INDEXED ONLINE PACKAGES:
    Have a warning if there are mis-labeled online packages and an option to move to the local/user packages folder?

PACKAGE INFO (Extras):
    Once that's all done, add a description field and a background color.

DISCORD CLEANUP:
    Archive channels and add a simplified guide for mods and creators
    Everyone: How to download the mod, how to play and use it, etc.
    Beatmap Creators: Creating a new OSU file
