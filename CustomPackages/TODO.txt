UI:
    Should be similar to before but simpler, with an ambiguous interface for displaying a package list and package info (works for local + server + verify)

SUBMISSION TESTER:
    Lists submissions and Automatically downloads + plays in a folder and deletes when it finishes

LOCAL BEATMAPS:
    Should be trivial.

PACKAGE INFO:
    Once that's all done, add a description field and a background color.

CREATE MODE (OSU mode):
    Similar to before but clean it up a bit.
    At the top: To make a beatmap, follow this guide (with a link)
    Pick an OSU file from a list and either EDIT or EXPORT
    When EXPORTING, a dialogue prompt pops up with some options (description, CD color)

HIGH SCORES:
    On beating a level, send your user ID and score data (the server does the mapping so the id's aren't exposed)

DISCORD CLEANUP:
    Archive channels and add a simplified guide for mods and creators
    Everyone: How to download the mod, how to play and use it, etc.
    Beatmap Creators: Creating a new OSU file
